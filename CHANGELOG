1.12
	I somehow managed to mangle version numbers of sub modules,
	now all properly incremented.

1.11
	fixed:
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/issues/6
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/issues/5
	This was NOT caused by polish characters, but by the
	password expire field being set (I didn't use it so far
	and my test database doesn't contain records with this
	field set). The 'W<*' pack identifier had been used
	for this field and W doesn't support < indeed. I changed
	it to use 'S<' now, which is a 2 byte little endian
	value according to the db-spec. I also edited the
	test database so that it contains the field now, so that
	a make test catches it.

	fixed cpantester problem with taintmode unlink() call,
	now $tmpfile is untainted before

1.10
	I forgot to fix the pack() format as well.

1.09
	the unpack() formatstring for the uuid (field 0x01) "L<4" didn't
	return a hex string, but a number only, which is fine for most
	cases, but isn't a correct Data::UUID representation. Changed back
	to "H*".

1.08
	fixed pack/unpack formats to use strictly little-endian values as required.
	machine-dependend unpack() formats changed to machine-independend.

1.07
	applied patch by  https://github.com/Mekk:
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/pull/3,
	fix import of Bytes::Random::Secure.

1.06
	applied patch by  https://github.com/Mekk:
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/pull/2,
	adds new function "deleterecord()", improves performance
	when using Bytes::Random::Secure[now optional] and fixes
	an error in ::Record::addfield().

1.05
	applied patch by https://github.com/Mekk:
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/pull/1,
	which replaces use of cp and mv commands with File::Copy.
	this makes it portable.

1.04

	fixed rt.cpan.org#75145. uninitialized fields lead to
        program abort. solved by pre-initializing them in the
        new records method. types notes and groups affected.

	fixed rt.cpan.org#75146. mtime will only modified if
	the passwd field changed. POD adjusted. Fix suggested
	by Luca Filipozzi - thx.


1.03
	after saving we do not mv the tmp file but copying
	it, because mv sometimes doesn't work with files the
	current user is not the owner but has write permissions
	while cp works on such files. so now we cp and unlink
	the tmpfile after saving.


1.02
	doc fix in ::Record (group separator is . not /)
	added Shell.pm to Makefile.PL dependencies


1.01
	bug fix in t/run.t


1.00
	initial version
